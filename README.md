# Explanation of the Structure:
## components/ directory:

This directory holds all the reusable React components that build up your website's user interface.

AboutSection.js: Contains the "About Us" content.

ContactForm.js: Manages the contact form's UI and client-side logic.

Footer.js: The common footer component for all pages.

Header.js: The common navigation header component.

HeroSection.js: The main introductory section of your homepage.

Layout.js: A wrapper component that provides a consistent structure (like header and footer) to all your pages.

ServicesSection.js: Displays the various services your business offers.

## pages/ directory:

This is a core Next.js directory where files define your website's routes and API endpoints.
# api/ directory:
contact.js: This is your serverless API route. When the contact form is submitted, the data is sent to this file, which acts as a backend endpoint to process the information (e.g., logging it, or in a real app, sending an email).

_app.js: This is a custom App component. It's used to initialize pages, apply global CSS (like your Tailwind CSS 
imports), and maintain state across page navigations.

index.js: This is the main homepage of your website. When a user visits your root URL (/), this file is rendered. It imports and combines the various components from the components/ directory to build the complete page.

## styles/ directory:

globals.css: This file is crucial for your design. It imports Tailwind CSS's base, components, and utility styles, and can also contain any custom global CSS rules you want to apply.

next.config.js: The main configuration file for your Next.js application. You can customize various aspects of Next.js here, like image optimization, environment variables, and webpack settings.

package.json: This file defines your project's metadata (name, version), scripts (e.g., dev, build, start), and lists all your project's dependencies (like react, next, tailwindcss).

postcss.config.js: Configuration for PostCSS, a tool that transforms CSS. It's used here by Tailwind CSS to process your styles.

tailwind.config.js: The configuration file for Tailwind CSS. This is where you customize Tailwind's default settings, extend its theme, and tell it which files to scan for Tailwind classes.

# How to Use Vercel to Run Full-Stack Next.js

Vercel is a cloud platform for frontend developers, specifically optimized for Next.js. It simplifies the deployment of full-stack Next.js applications by automatically handling both the frontend (React components) and the backend (Next.js API routes) as serverless functions.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have:

* **A GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket) Repository:** Your Next.js project must be pushed to a Git repository. (e.g., `https://github.com/bhousxrenz/my-business-website`).
* **A Vercel Account:** If you don't have one, sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/). You can sign up easily using your GitHub account.

## 2. Connect Your Git Account to Vercel

1.  **Log in to Vercel:** Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) and log in.
2.  **Add New Project:** Click the **"Add New..."** button (or the "+" icon) in the top right corner, then select **"Project"**.
3.  **Import Git Repository:** Vercel will prompt you to import a Git repository.
    * Choose **"Continue with GitHub"** (or your preferred Git provider).
    * You might need to authorize Vercel to access your GitHub repositories. You can choose to grant access to all repositories or select specific ones. If you choose specific ones, make sure to grant access to your project repository.

## 3. Import Your Next.js Project

1.  **Select Your Repository:** Once Vercel has access, you'll see a list of your repositories. Find and select your Next.js project repository.
2.  **Configure Project (Automatic Detection):**
    * Vercel will automatically detect that your project is a **Next.js application**.
    * It will pre-fill the "Framework Preset" as `Next.js`.
    * It will automatically set the "Root Directory" (usually `/`).
    * It will also automatically configure the "Build Command" (`next build`) and "Output Directory" (`.next`).
3.  **Environment Variables (Optional but Important):**
    * If your Next.js application uses environment variables (e.g., API keys, database connection strings), you'll need to add them here.
    * Scroll down to the "Environment Variables" section.
    * Add each variable as a **Key-Value pair**. These variables will be securely injected into your build and runtime environment.

## 4. Deploy Your Project

1.  **Click "Deploy":** After reviewing the settings, click the **"Deploy"** button.
2.  **Build and Deployment Process:**
    * Vercel will clone your repository.
    * It will install all dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn install`).
    * It will run the build command (`next build`). During this phase, Next.js compiles your React components and also creates serverless functions for your API routes (`pages/api/*`).
    * Finally, it will deploy your application to its global CDN (Content Delivery Network).

## 5. Access Your Deployed Website

* Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a unique **deployment URL** (e.g., `my-business-website-xxxx.vercel.app`).
* You can click on this URL to view your live website.
* Vercel also assigns a production URL to your project (e.g., `my-business-website.vercel.app`) which always points to your latest successful production deployment.

# How Vercel Handles Full-Stack Next.js:

Vercel's magic with Next.js lies in its ability to seamlessly integrate the frontend and backend:

* **Automatic Serverless Functions:** Every file inside your `pages/api` directory (like `contact.js`) is automatically treated as a **serverless function** by Vercel. This means:
    * They are deployed independently.
    * They only run when requested (e.g., when your contact form is submitted).
    * You pay only for the compute time they consume, making them highly scalable and cost-effective.
* **Static Site Generation (SSG) / Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Vercel fully supports Next.js's rendering capabilities. Pages that are statically generated (`getStaticProps`) are served instantly from the CDN, while server-side rendered pages (`getServerSideProps`) are executed as serverless functions on demand.
* **Global CDN:** Your website's static assets and serverless functions are distributed globally, ensuring fast loading times for users worldwide.
* **Instant Previews:** Every time you push a new branch to GitHub, Vercel can automatically create a unique preview deployment. This allows you to test changes in a live environment before merging them to your `main` branch.
* **Logs:** You can view the `console.log` output from your API routes (like `console.log('Contact form submission received:')` in `contact.js`) directly in the Vercel dashboard under the "Functions" or "Logs" tab for a specific deployment. This is crucial for debugging your backend logic.

# How to See Contact Form Submissions

When a user submits the contact form on your website, there are two main places where you can observe the "send message" action:

## 1. Frontend Confirmation (On the Website)

* **What you see:** After a successful submission, a green success message, "Message sent successfully! We'll be in touch soon," appears directly below the "Send Message" button on the website.
* **How it works:** This message is controlled by the `ContactForm.js` component. When the `fetch` request to your `/api/contact` endpoint is successful (meaning the server responded with an `OK` status), the component's internal `status` state is updated to `'success'`, which then conditionally renders this confirmation text.

## 2. Backend Logs (On Vercel)

* **What it is:** Your `pages/api/contact.js` file is a serverless function that processes the form data. The `console.log` statements within this file capture the submitted `name`, `email`, and `message`. These logs are visible in your Vercel deployment dashboard.
* **How to see the logs:**
    1.  **Log in to Vercel:** Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) and log in.
    2.  **Select Your Project:** Navigate to your `my-business-website` project.
    3.  **Go to Deployments:** Click on the "Deployments" tab.
    4.  **Choose a Deployment:** Select the specific deployment you want to inspect (usually the latest production deployment).
    5.  **View Function Logs:**
        * Look for the **"Functions"** or **"Logs"** tab/section.
        * Find and click on your `/api/contact` function.
        * Here, you will see the `console.log` outputs (`Name:`, `Email:`, `Message:`) for each time the contact form was successfully submitted on your live Vercel website. This allows you to verify that the backend received the data
